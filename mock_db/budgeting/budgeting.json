    "What is a budget? A budget is a plan for your spending. Tracking your purchases and living within a budget allows you to be confident that you’ve got the money to cover your essential living expenses. You’ll also be ready when unplanned expenses pop up, and even you’re able to pursue the things in life that are important to you.",
    "If you earn a monthly income of $3,000, is that enough to pay for housing, food, insurance, health care, debt repayment and having fun without running out of money? That’s a lot to cover with a limited amount, but making a budget can determine if it’s possible."
